                <p>
                Footsteps. It takes time to learn someone's footsteps, often a lifetime. Once you familiarize yourself with someone's footsteps you can pick them out in a crowd, albeit a small crowd. Your mother's footsteps shuffling up the stairs to release you from your prison. Your fatherâ€™s steps as he comes home from work, how he wipes off his feet on the doorstep so as not to anger mother. Your sister as she tries to sneak up on you for a little prank, although never succeeding. Your brother ducking out of the bedroom window to see some friends at midnight, or someone more than a friend. Your significant other, your lover, your life long friend, as they walk beside you always through life. Above all, when you hear the footsteps of your children, from their first to your last.
